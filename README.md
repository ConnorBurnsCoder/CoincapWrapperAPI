# CoincapWrapperAPI

To execute the API:
You must already have python and Flask installed
https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/

We also use the requests library https://pypi.org/project/requests/ and FuzzyWuzzy https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy

In Windows PowerShell go the to folder where App.py is located and type "flask run" Then open a browser to http://127.0.0.1:5000/
